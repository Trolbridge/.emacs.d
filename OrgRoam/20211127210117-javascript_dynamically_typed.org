#+title: JavaScript Dynamically Typed


* Dynamically Typed Language

- Types are associated with values not variables
- Same variable can hold multple types
- Do not need to specify types
- Most other languages are statically typed (java, c#, c++)
- There are supersets of JS and addons to allow static typing (TypeScript, Flow)
