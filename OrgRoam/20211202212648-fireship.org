- Rarely implement his own classes 
- Never use inheritance
- use modules that export functions and plan objects. that makes the code reshapable so dead code can be elimitated
- dont have to worry about constructors, getters / setters, this. which adds uneccary complexity
- but there are some classes that a class is a really nice way to encapsuate something
- It's fine if you don't know. But you're fired if you can't even google it.
- [[id:EEFBD614-45EA-4931-A5EF-A0DF023AEFC2][Google]] is a skill
